## Introduction: 

This course will help you critically assess the political perspectives
on contemporary issues related to the politics of cyberspace and
cyber-governance. This course will help you explore the theoretical
perspectives on cyberpolitics, as well as key issues, debates and topics
in cyber threats. We will address a range of theories about cyberspace
and relevant actors as well as decision-making procedures, the role of
corporate, public and personal issues, including fake news, hacking,
disinformation, sharp power, cyber conflict and international legal
norms.

## Learning Objectives:

Through this course all students will have the opportunity to:

• Identify the relevant actors for cyber threats and cyber responses

• Evaluate a key cyber event or issue

• Acquire a historical context of cyber governance

• Identify key issues in contemporary cyberpolitics as well as
country-specific cyber responses

## For all written work in this course: 

## Paragraph structure 

Basic paragraph structure is an important part of writing. Failure to
use basic paragraph structure will result in repetitive, unstructured,
illogical arguments. Paragraphs help to structure our thought, our
ability to make claims and provide a framework for writing. The topic
sentence and concluding sentence of each paragraph should be in your own
voice (no direct references, quotations or citations). A basic paragraph
structure should follow this template:

- Topic/introduction, in one or two sentences and has an argumentative
  sentence that avoids description, and has a clear political thesis

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Major point with factual evidence, one or two sentences (one sentence
  with ***relevant*** academic citation and one sentence explaining the
  relevance in your own words, demonstrating individual voice and
  reflection)

- Summarizing sentence of overall significance to the overarching thesis
  of the paper and

- Concluding sentence which restates topic sentence and bridges to next
  paragraph.

Failure to use basic paragraph structure throughout your work will
result in the inability to receive full marks.

These paragraph formatting requirements are not arbitrary. There is a
specific reason that I want you to use peer-reviewed academic sources, a
MINIMUM of THREE DIFFERENT ACADEMIC SOURCES per paragraph. WHY?

- First, the difference between opinion and argument is the provision of
  evidence.

- Second, for an academic argument to have veracity, it needs to have an
  arm\'s length perspective, it needs to draw on peer-reviewed sources
  because individual interpretation is prone to error.

- Next, if we have more than one academic source per paragraph if one of
  those sources is weak or questionable the other two will supplement
  it.

- Moreover, multiple sources prevent summary or representation of
  someone else\'s ideas as your own, if you must interpret multiple data
  sources.

- Finally, academic sources have explanatory frameworks that link them
  to underlying theoretical concepts and ideas. News sources, data
  points, and journalism provide evidence without analysis, academic
  work provides analysis with evidence. If you don\'t have that
  consistently throughout your writing, you are going to run into
  problems of the veracity of your claims because they lack
  substantiation.

If any of your sentences, paragraphs, or quotations lack a specific
foundation, you will not receive credit for those submissions.

Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the era of LLMs, inaccurate
citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs routinely
summarize sources without accessing the underlying data. **Failure to
directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an explanation
in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient citation.**
**Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient justification for including a
citation**; you must use specific and precise language, including nouns
(specific people, places, and things), as generalized summaries of
sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate, and incomplete when
suggested by LLMs.

Weasel words---vague or evasive language that obscures
meaning---undermine thesis-driven political arguments by avoiding clear
claims and weakening the connection between evidence and position. As
Theodore Roosevelt warned in 1916, they drain content from statements
like a weasel empties an egg: the form remains, but the substance is
gone. In political science, precision matters. Ambiguity dilutes
argument.

Why are weasel words proliferating?

- LLMs avoid strong claims to minimize liability, leading to weasel
  words.

- They replicate academic tone through pattern-matching, not reasoning,
  producing vague phrasing.

- They favor generalizations to ensure broad applicability and avoid
  exclusion.

- They use soft language to evade controversy or implied stance.

- Their training data overrepresents cautious, formulaic academic prose.

- They default to description over argument due to lack of critical
  capacity.

## General information about missed coursework

Students must familiarize themselves with the *University Policy on
Academic Consideration -- Undergraduate Students in First Entry
Programs* posted on the Academic Calendar:

<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/academic_consideration_Sep24.pdf>,

This policy does not apply to requests for Academic Consideration
submitted for **attempted or completed work**, whether online or in
person.

The policy also does not apply to students experiencing longer-term
impacts on their academic responsibilities. These students should
consult [Accessible
Education](http://academicsupport.uwo.ca/accessible_education/).

For procedures on how to submit Academic Consideration requests, please
see the information posted on the Office of the Registrar's webpage:

<https://registrar.uwo.ca/academics/academic_considerations/>

All requests for Academic Consideration must be made within 48 hours
after the assessment date or submission deadline.

All Academic Consideration requests must include supporting
documentation; however, recognizing that formal documentation may not be
available in some extenuating circumstances, the policy allows students
to make [one]{.underline} Academic Consideration request **without
supporting documentation** in this course. However, the following
assessments are excluded from this, and therefore always require formal
supporting documentation:

Term Assignment -- 15%

When a student *[mistakenly]{.underline}* submits their
[one]{.underline} allowed Academic Consideration request **without
supporting documentation** for the assessments listed above or those in
the **Coursework with Assessment Flexibility** section below, [the
request cannot be recalled and reapplied]{.underline}. This privilege is
forfeited.

Coursework with Assessment Flexibility

By policy, instructors may deny Academic Consideration requests for the
following assessments with built-in flexibility.

Flexible Completion assignments:

Weekly participation. This course has 12 weekly participation
assignments, and the 10 quizzes with the highest marks are counted
towards your final grade. Should extenuating circumstances arise,
students do not need to request Academic Consideration for the first 2
missed weekly participations. Academic consideration requests will be
denied for the first 2 missed weekly participation assignments.

Religious Accommodation

When conflicts with a religious holiday that requires an absence from
the University or prohibits certain activities, students should request
an accommodation for their absence in writing to the course instructor
and/or the Academic Advising office of their Faculty of Registration.
This notice should be made as early as possible but not later than two
weeks prior to the writing or the examination (or one week prior to the
writing of the test).

Please visit the Diversity Calendars posted on our university's EDID
website for the recognized religious holidays:
[https://www.edi.uwo.ca](https://www.edi.uwo.ca/)

Accommodation Policies

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact Accessible
Education, which provides recommendations for accommodation based on
medical documentation or psychological and cognitive testing. The policy
on Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities can be found
at:
<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/Academic%20Accommodation_disabilities.pdf>

In accordance with policy,
<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/policies_procedures/section1/mapp113.pdf>

the centrally administered e-mail account provided to students will be
considered the individual's official university e-mail address. It is
the responsibility of the account holder to ensure that e-mail received
from the University at their official university address is attended to
in a timely manner.

Scholastic offences are taken seriously and students are directed to
read the appropriate policy, specifically, the definition of what
constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site:

<https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/scholastic_discipline_undergrad.pdf>

All required papers may be subject to submission for textual similarity
review to the commercial plagiarism detection software under license to
the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for
such checking will be included as source documents in the reference
database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of papers subsequently
submitted to the system. Use of the service is subject to the licensing
agreement, currently between The University of Western Ontario and
Turnitin.com ([http://www.turnitin.com](http://www.turnitin.com/)).

## Weekly Participation -- 20% (Weekly submissions) 

Weekly Assignments -- Base submission is pass/fail 70% (14 of 20)

Students **must** complete a minimum of **two engagement options
weekly** (Monday 12:01 am - Sunday 11:59 pm) to fulfill participation
requirements. Quizzes can be completed each week for one participation
mark . The remaining forms of participation can only be done twice each
during the entire course (i.e. you can only do 2 tiktoks per semester).
You can collaborate with peers on submissions, but they must be
submitted individually. You must adopt 5 different forms of
participation throughout the course to build your portfolio and prevent
rote production of participation. A total of 10 weeks of participation
is required, allowing students to skip 2 weeks (e.g., weeks 1 and 12).
Completing 10 weeks fulfills the full 70%. If you are submitting the
same assignment for a second time, make sure to address 'What did I do
differently this week?'

Weekly Engagement Options (a minimum of two options required per week):

1.  Written Responses (250 words per lesson): A reflective analysis
    engaging with lesson ideas and concepts from lectures, readings, or
    both. This is not a summary but a critical engagement that links
    material to current international issues. Proper essay paragraph
    structure and intext citations are required where applicable. You
    must reference the course readings at least three times per week to
    get maximum grades. Submissions not meeting these standards are
    ineligible for full credit. Each written response counts for one
    participation mark. See detailed criteria below.

2.  Video Responses: A short (TikTok-style) video exploring a key
    academic issue from each lesson's content, suitable for a general
    audience. Videos must reference at least one academic, peer-reviewed
    source from our reading list and can be uploaded to Brightspace each
    week (or linked if hosted elsewhere). Public posting is not
    required. Each video counts for one participation mark.

3.  Other forms of participation from this list:
    <https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/Assessment-AI-Strategies>
    excluding: True/False Questions, Quiz, Exams and Tests,
    Fill-in-the-Blank Questions, Close Reading with Questions, Diagram
    or Image-Based Questions, Summary. If you have any questions please
    contact the instructor about the viability of your participation.

> Sample weekly participation submission:![Picture 565367195, Picture,
> Picture](/media/image.png){width="4.989583333333333in"
> height="1.78125in"}

A Final calculation activity is **required** to receive your
participation mark.

At the end of the course students just need to calculate their
participation based on the submissions each week throughout the course.
We will take your top 5 weeks.\
\
2 forms of participation per week = 70% (pass/fail)\
\
More than 2 forms of participation each week, or substantive improvement
can result in a higher grade (the 80, 85 and 90 grades below are
approximations, I withhold the right to assess the quality of the
submission and adjust the grade accordingly). You should be able to
demonstrate responding to my feedback, engaging with different course
material each week to demonstrate improvement throughout the course.
Therefore, the calculation would look like:

'This is my calculation of my participation: are you riding today it\'s
not going to come to the cottage cuz the weekends don\'t work

- 2 forms of participation: 2x on weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, 10 (I did the
  quizzes and another exercise) 5\*70 = 350 & I responded to feedback
  (see the attached files, improving my citation and paragraph structure
  ) =10\*50 = 400/500

- 3 forms of participation: Week 4, 5 (I did 2 quizzes and 2 TikTok\'s
  and two op-eds) = 2\* 80 = 160/200

- 4 forms of participation: Week 6, 8, 9 = (I did 3 quizzes, 2 article
  reviews, 2 debates, 2 podcasts) = 3\*90 & 10% because you said I
  improved the podcasts = 3\*100 = 300/300

- Total calculation:\
  400+200+300 = 900/1000 = 90% or 18/20\
  Therefore, my participation for the term should be 18 out of 20 -
  please see the attached files to demonstrate my improvement.'

Frameworks for presentations, media assessments, and final papers. All
assignments in this course should orient their papers around one of
these debates.

- Walled Gardens vs. Government Regulation --- Focuses on governance
  models: private platform control versus public/legal oversight.

- Security Through Obfuscation vs. Security Through Openness --- Focuses
  on epistemic and control strategies in cybersecurity: secrecy,
  proprietary knowledge versus transparency, academic and civic review.

- Innovation vs. Infrastructure --- Focuses on temporal and material
  dynamics: agility, experimentation, and disruption versus stability,
  path dependence, and systemic inertia.

## Term Assignment -- Option 1 - Cyber Event Framing Assessment: 15% of final course grade.

This assignment will critically engage with a cyber-event or issue to
assess the political framing and response to the event. It should use
one of the events in: Middleton, Bruce. A history of cyber security
attacks: 1980 to present. CRC Press, 2017, or from Marion, Nancy E., and
Jason Twede. Cybercrime: An Encyclopedia of Digital Crime. ABC-CLIO,
2020 or another relevant topic approved by the instructor in advance. No
one is allowed to present on the topic of Stuxnet. This assignment will
assess the framing of the event be relevant parties (state agencies,
private cyber-security actors, hackers, the cybersecurity community,
citizen groups, the public at large, etc) to see how the frameworks of
cyberpolitics are deployed. It must critically assess the framing of the
event using academic sources and the textbook and can be presented in 2
ways.

> 1\. A written report (essay) which assesses the framing of the issue,
> and the viability of the arguments given the academic debates on the
> issue. The written assignment should be a minimum of 1250 words, in
> proper essay format (with title page and bibliography) and have a
> minimum of 4 academic sources primarily from the course. Due the end
> of Week 7.
>
> 2\. An in-class presentation. A brief description of the event (or
> relevant media) should be distributed to the class (subject to
> instructor prior approval, and following class guidelines) and the
> presenter should outline their interpretation of the event for the
> class. The presenter will then prepare a short exercise, role playing
> or creative interactive exercise to raise issues and ideas that stem
> from the event and their critical interpretation of it. All exercises
> must be preapproved by the instructor and cannot be presented without
> the instructor's approval. A minimum of three academic sources are
> required one from our course readings. All materials should be made
> available one week before the presentation including the presentation
> slides.

For an example of a cyber framing event media assessment see the link in
brightspace

## Term Assignment -- Option 2 - Media Assessment: 15% of final course grade.

Media Assessment - This assignment will critically engage with the
depiction of a key issue event or incident in relation to cyberpolitics
and cyber governance. All media options must be approved by the
instructor before proceeding with the assignment. Media should be
popular and publicly available, such as motion pictures, short films,
documentaries or special reports, and have a clear argument that can be
assessed academically using our course texts. Signup for the media
assessment will take place on Brightspace. The media assessment must
critically engage with the content and argument of the media for its use
in understanding a contemporary argument about cyberpolitics and cyber
governance. This critical assessment can be presented in 2 ways.

> 1\. A written report (essay) which assesses the media for its
> arguments about cyberpolitics and cyber governance, as it relates to
> course materials. The viability of the arguments given the academic
> debates on the issue is the focus. It does not need to be
> comprehensive it simply needs to focus on three key arguments in the
> media .The written assignment should be a minimum of 1250 words, in
> proper essay format (with title page and bibliography) and have a
> minimum of 4 academic sources, primarily from course readings. **Due
> the end of Week 7.**
>
> 2\. An in-class presentation. A section or short part (maximum 5
> minutes) of media should be distributed to the class (subject to
> instructor prior approval and following class guidelines) and the
> presenter should outline their interpretation of the argument for the
> class. The presenter will then prepare a short exercise, role playing
> or creative interactive exercise to raise issues and ideas that stem
> from media and their critical interpretation of it. A minimum of 4
> academic sources are required for the assignment, primarily from
> course readings.

## Country based Presentation -- 20% of final grade

Student Presentations: 20% of final course grade.

The student presentation is a two-part exercise. During the first-class
students will select a policy from the 'country-based' text for the week
of their provocation- this is *Romaniuk, Scott N., and Mary Manjikian,
eds. Routledge companion to global cyber-security strategy. Routledge,
2021.* Each student will find at least one link to an academic article
on a recent cyberpolitical event in that country and post it for the
class at least one week prior to the class in which they present.
Failure to post a reading for the class will make it impossible to
achieve full marks on the assignment. Each student will prepare a very
short (5 minutes maximum) exercise to stimulate class discussion on an
issue related to that country's policy. THIS IS NOT A SUMMARY. Students
should prepare a short exercise, role playing or creative interactive
exercise to raise issues and ideas that stem from the discussion
questions or their reading for the week. Students do not necessarily
need to present orally to the class, as long as they provide clear
instructions and facilitate the exercise. No one is allowed to present
on Stuxnet as their topic. The goal of the exercise is to raise
analytical issues and concerns with the course material rather than
summarize or re-present the material. All exercises must be preapproved
by the instructor and cannot be presented without the instructor's
approval. A minimum of three academic sources is required, and at least
one from the course readings. All materials should be made available one
week before the presentation including the presentation slides.

## Essay: 45% of final grade due March 26, 2025.

Length: 3,000- 3,750 words (12- 15 pages), typed and double spaced.
Pages should be numbered, and the type of font should be no smaller than
12 characters per inch (e.g., Arial 12). Students must submit their
papers through the assignment tab in OWL and all papers may be processed
by Turnitin. The instructor may require that 10% of randomly selected
students will have to meet to discuss their paper in person after
completion.

Option 1: Critical book assessment. Students will choose a book from the
course outline list above as the focus of their paper. They will review
the book with the critical insights of the course and the textbook to
examine the implicit or explicit assumptions about cyberpolitics. In
doing so, students should provide a critical reading utilizing other
academic sources about the veracity of the claims in the book. This is
NOT A BOOK REVIEW; it is an opportunity to examine the claims and
arguments made with evidence by both the author and critical academic
counterevidence from your research. The sources should be primarily
academic for argumentation, but non-academic sources can be used for
evidence. A minimum of six sources from our course readings are required
in your analysis.

Option 2: Essay on cyberpolitical issues 45% of final grade

Length: 3,000- 3,750 words (12- 15 pages), typed and double spaced.
Pages should be numbered, and the type of font should be no smaller than
12 characters per inch (e.g., Arial 12). Students must submit their
papers through the assignment tab in OWL and all papers may be processed
by Turnitin.

Topics: Students choose their own essay topics, but such choices must be
approved by the instructor. No one is allowed to write on Stuxnet. The
essay must have, as part of its introduction, a statement of its thesis
(central argument). This thesis must be supported by a careful analysis
of relevant data and arguments in the body of the paper. The assignment
must be in proper formal essay format (no bullet points, short form or
colloquial language, can use subheadings to identify sections, use
proper citation and should NOT INCLUDE ANY FORM OF ANNOTATED
BIBLIOGRAPHY. Dictionaries, encyclopedias, and Wikipedia should not be
used, and use of web material is subject to instructor's prior approval.
A basic structure for the essay will include:

1\) Title, topic and thesis question or area of interest for potential
research.

2\) One dominant approach to study the issue. The dominant approach will
provide the explanatory foundation of the thesis, more than one approach
can be used, but the primary approach should be linked to the
explanatory assertion of the thesis.

3\) Three key distinct arguments with evidence in support of the thesis.
Remember to follow the paragraph structure in the course outline. The
data should primarily come from course readings, the pre-approved
suggested readings, and suggested texts. Students must engage with at
least six course texts to complete the assignment, and most of your
academic sources should come from the required and optional readings in
the course outline.

4\) A conclusion that mirrors your title, topic and thesis question. It
is always a good idea to rewrite your introduction after you have
written your conclusion. Your conclusion should provide the clear
foundation that you have established throughout the essay, to
demonstrate the validity of your thesis. Therefore, your thesis and your
conclusion should match one another. Failure to have consistent
argumentation will result in the inability to achieve full grades.

5\) Properly cited research. In text citation is preferred (author date
system, as outlined below in 'guidelines for success in class). There
should be no proxy urls (<https://www.lib.uwo.ca/>) no search urls
(<http://search.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/>) or Dropbox urls
(<https://www.dropbox.com/>). Citations need to be consistently
formatted, readily available, in English, with precise page numbers (no
inclusion of p.23-44, or consistent citation across pages (i.e.
p.118-119). Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the era of LLMs,
inaccurate citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs
routinely summarize sources without accessing the underlying data.
Failure to directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an
explanation in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient
citation. Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient justification for
including a citation; you must use specific and precise language,
including nouns (specific people, places, and things), as generalized
summaries of sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate, and incomplete
when suggested by LLMs.

6\) A title page with your name, a title for your paper that reflects
the thesis and topic of your paper, the date of submission and the
course number on it. If you cannot clearly and simply identify the title
and topic of your paper, it is often an indicator of a lack of focus.

Papers submitted before the deadline can revise and resubmit the
assignment. For details on revision and resubmission see the 'revise and
resubmit' tab in OWL.

## Zoom Etiquette

1.  Please pay attention to video, microphone and screensharing
    settings. Keep chat rooms and images appropriate for an academic
    setting. Any inappropriate actions, imagery, discussion or chat
    messages may result in your removal from the meeting at my
    discretion. Audio recordings may be available as an alternative to
    synchronous discussion.

2.  Please test all WIFI, video and audio before the meetings. Zoom
    buttons for raising your hand, responding yes and no, asking host to
    adjust speed, requesting a break and more.

3.  Please be conscious of your speaking time and that of others, if you
    are continuing in a manner that is not fair to your peers, I reserve
    the right to intervene and put us back on a more focused discussion.

## Recording synchronous content (office hours or other meetings)

All of the remote learning sessions and Zoom meetings (including office
hours) for this course **may** be recorded. The data captured during
these recordings may include your image, voice recordings, chat logs and
personal identifiers (name displayed on the screen). The recordings may
be used for educational purposes related to this course, including
evaluations and assisting with preparation of your assignments (you can
request a copy of the meeting). The recordings may be disclosed to other
individuals participating in the course for their private or group study
purposes. Please contact the instructor if you have any concerns related
to session recordings. Participants in this course are not permitted to
record the sessions, except where recording is an approved
accommodation, or the participant has the prior written permission of
the instructor.

Notes: The Department's rules regarding plagiarism and the submission of
similar essays to two or more different instructors are appended to this
course outline and should be noted. (See 'Criteria for Evaluation of
Written Assignments' below).

Guidelines for Success in Class

Since there seldom are definitive answers to the questions we will be
asking about cyberpolitics, and much of what you will learn in this
course will be enhanced by the ideas and perspectives of your
colleagues. But for this to work, everyone must participate fully and
constructively. Be mindful of the following points, and you will be
successful:

> • Come to all classes having read the assigned readings for that week
> and prepared to participate in discussion. It is useful to remember
> that some week's readings may be more relevant to your research
> interests than others, and focusing on readings that are most salient
> to your interests will ensure maximum usefulness in the course.
>
> • Participate in discussions, but do not over-participate. Everyone
> must be given an opportunity to take part in discussions. Constructive
> participation involves the raising of relevant points and ideas.
> Online participation will be considered as well in participation
> marks.
>
> • Demonstrate respect for the ideas presented by others at all times.
> This is essential to open discussion and the free exchange of ideas.
> This does not mean that you must agree with others. Informal debate
> will teach you even more about your own position while simultaneously
> exposing you to different viewpoints. Make use of such opportunities,
> but no disrespectful behavior will be tolerated.
>
> • Raise questions when you have them. Raising useful questions counts
> as participation. You can use minute papers, online forums, e-mail,
> facebook or in class lecture to raise questions you encounter
> throughout the course. Uncertainties are usually shared by others --
> when you raise your questions in class everyone learns while you build
> your own participation grade.

# Criteria for Evaluation of Written Assignments 

These criteria will be used in evaluation of written work. Please be
sure to read them carefully.

## Paragraph structure 

Basic paragraph structure is an important part of writing. Failure to
use basic paragraph structure will result in repetitive, unstructured,
illogical arguments. Paragraphs help to structure our thought, our
ability to make claims and provide a framework for writing. The topic
sentence and concluding sentence of each paragraph should be in your own
voice (no direct references, quotations or citations). A basic paragraph
structure should follow this template:

- Topic/introduction, in one or two sentences

- Major point with evidence one or two sentences (one sentence with
  academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your
  own words)

- Major point with evidence one or two sentences (one sentence with
  academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your
  own words)

- Major point with evidence one or two sentences (one sentence with
  academic citation and one sentence explaining the relevance in your
  own words)

- Summarizing sentence of overall significance to the overarching thesis
  of the paper and

- Concluding sentence which restates topic sentence and bridges to next
  paragraph.

Failure to use basic paragraph structure throughout your work will
result in the inability to receive full marks.

These paragraph formatting requirements are not arbitrary. There is a
specific reason that I want you to use peer-reviewed academic sources, a
MINIMUM of THREE DIFFERENT ACADEMIC SOURCES per paragraph. WHY?

- First, the difference between opinion and argument is the provision of
  evidence.

- Second, for an academic argument to have veracity, it needs to have an
  arm\'s length perspective, it needs to draw on peer-reviewed sources
  because individual interpretation is prone to error.

- Next, if we have more than one academic source per paragraph if one of
  those sources is weak or questionable the other two will supplement
  it.

- Moreover, multiple sources prevent summary or representation of
  someone else\'s ideas as your own, if you must interpret multiple data
  sources.

- Finally, academic sources have explanatory frameworks that link them
  to underlying theoretical concepts and ideas. News sources, data
  points, and journalism provide evidence without analysis, academic
  work provides analysis with evidence. If you don\'t have that
  consistently throughout your writing, you are going to run into
  problems of the veracity of your claims because they lack
  substantiation.

## Formatting

All work should be double spaced using 12-point font (even on policy
briefs). Page numbers should always be included. Never use bullet points
anywhere -- they condense ideas when I need to see the logic and
academic argumentation that underpin your claims.

## Quotations

Quotations longer than 4 lines should be indented. Try to avoid
quotations longer than 4 lines. Assume that I do not read an indented
4line quotation and make sure the sentence immediately following the
quotation summarizes its significance to your argument in your own
words. Never include quotations or sources in your introduction or
conclusion, your introduction and conclusion should outline the paper
structure in your own words.

## Citations and Bibliography

We will use the author date system. It keeps footnotes and endnotes to a
minimum.

Text references will be short with the Surname, Date and page number
(i.e. Žižek 2002: 342).

Use this formatting everywhere, including sources from our reading list
and in the response papers and any written work.

Works by the same author in the same year should be cited as Žižek
2002a, Žižek2002b, etc.

Et al. can be used by sources with three or more authors. The full list
must be in the bibliography.

If you have more than one source in the same sentence you just include
them with a semi-colon in chronological order i.e (Žižek 2002: 345;
D'Amelio 2018: 212; Swift 2020: 445)

If any of your sentences, paragraphs, or quotations lack a specific
foundation, you will not receive credit for those submissions.

Lack of data is a lack of foundation. In the era of LLMs, inaccurate
citations will be treated as no citation at all. LLMs routinely
summarize sources without accessing the underlying data. **Failure to
directly quote sources with quotation marks followed by an explanation
in your own words will constitute a lack of sufficient citation.**
**Paraphrasing is no longer sufficient justification for including a
citation**; you must use specific and precise language, including nouns
(specific people, places, and things), as generalized summaries of
sources are often hallucinated, inaccurate, and incomplete when
suggested by LLMs.

## Bibliography (style: Modified Harvard)

> the complete details of the work and included an 'Accessed' date if it
> is an online source.

## Analytical Content and Paragraph structure:

Higher grades will be given to work that demonstrates the ability to
interpret, critically assess and develop insights of the material. To
determine whether or not your argument is analytical, ask yourself \"Am
I demonstrating to the reader my insights in an academic way?" If you
are simply summarizing or describing in detail phenomena, your work is
unlikely to have high analytical content.

> *Helpful signs you are not developing analytical content: Excessive
> quotes; beginning or ending a paragraph with a quote; short (fewer
> than 4 sentences) paragraphs; no sources in a long paragraph; lack of
> similar argument in introduction and conclusion.*

## Development of an Argument:

Higher grades will be given to work that has a clearly stated argument
and a set of logically developed and reasonably comprehensive points in
support of that argument. Academic arguments need not be personal
(though in certain instances they can be -- check with the instructor),
rather they demonstrate the logical progression of the position you are
developing. The key here is to attempt to convince your reader of the
soundness or feasibility of your argument. Nuanced arguments recognize
obvious criticisms and seek to address them logically. Consistency of an
argument throughout a paper is important.

> *Helpful signs your argument may be in trouble: Using the same author
> or quote more than a few times in successive paragraphs; your
> introduction and conclusion are not similar; you introduce material in
> the introduction and the conclusion that cannot be found elsewhere;
> you have quotes in your conclusion; your attempt to address obvious
> criticisms contradicts your thesis, you adopt multiple theoretical
> frameworks; you cannot find any sources that agree with your central
> claims.*

## Grammar, Spelling, and Style: 

Higher grades will be given to written work that is grammatically
correct and is clearly and accurately written, while lower grades will
be given to work that is difficult to read or understand due to
excessive grammatical and/or spelling errors.

> *While different approaches work for different people, it is
> recommended that you try the following every time you have a written
> assignment: after completing your assignment, put it away for a while
> (ideally, for a few days); when you pick it up again, read it
> carefully, slowly, and aloud (when we are familiar with a paper we
> tend to skim it during proof-reading, thereby missing errors -- so
> make sure you are reading it word for word). Mistakes in grammar may
> not always look wrong, but they usually sound wrong. If you need some
> help with writing style or grammar, there are many resources available
> on campus.*

# General

All students must complete all course requirements. Failure to do so
(e.g., by not handing-in an assignment or by missing an examination
without due cause) will subject the student to the appropriate
University regulations. Students must also keep a duplicate copy of
their assignments.

## Policy on communication

The forums should be your primary place for questions, issues and
concerns with the course. I strive to be accessible and responsive to
student inquiries. However, repeated or persistent e-mails/texts/phone
calls will overload my capacity to respond to all students equally. As
such, I reserve the right to answer initial questions but forego
multiple responses or inquires for a 24hour cool-down period. I
appreciate your understanding in this matter.

## Policy on Children in the classroom^1^ 

"It is my belief that if we want women in academia, that we should also
expect children to be present in some form. Currently, the university
does not have a formal policy on children in the classroom. The policy
described here is thus, a reflection of my own beliefs and commitments
to student, staff and faculty parents.

All exclusively breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as is
necessary to support the breastfeeding relationship. Because not all
women can pump sufficient milk, and not all babies will take a bottle
reliably, I never want students to feel like they have to choose between
feeding their baby and continuing their education. You and your nursing
baby are welcome in class anytime.

For older children and babies, I understand that minor illnesses and
unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of
having to choose between missing class to stay home with a child and
leaving him or her with someone you or the child does not feel
comfortable with. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare
solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps
in care is perfectly acceptable.

I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment
that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in
parenting status.

In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit
close to the door so that if your little one needs special attention and
is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until
their need has been met. Non-parents in the class, please reserve seats
near the door for your parenting classmates.

Finally, I understand that often the largest barrier to completing your
coursework once you become a parent is the tiredness many parents feel
in the evening once children have finally gone to sleep. The struggles
of balancing school, childcare and often another job are exhausting! I
hope that you will feel comfortable disclosing your student-parent
status to me. This is the first step in my being able to accommodate any
special needs that arise. While I maintain the same high expectations
for all student in my classes regardless of parenting status, I am happy
to problem solve with you in a way that makes you feel supported as you
strive for school-parenting balance. Thank you for the diversity you
bring to our classroom!"

## Policy on non-service animals in the classroom 

Western University established a [Pets and Therapy Animals policy in May
2020](https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/policies_procedures/section1/mapp156.pdf)
that limits the presence of pets in campus buildings. Service and
therapy animals are permitted inside all Western locations, in
accordance with accessibility policies, however animals for
companionship are not allowed.

## Point of View

The readings, class lectures, and my comments in class will suggest a
particular point of view. This perspective is my own and does not have
to be yours! I encourage you to disagree with the ideas in the readings
and lectures as well as the perspectives of your colleagues in the
course. Please express yourself! A significant part of a university
education is learning about the complexity of various issues; therefore,
it is important that we listen and respect one another but we do not
have to agree. A richer discussion will occur when a variety of
perspectives are presented in class for discussion.

## Academic Sources

A key aspect of the university experience is developing your ability to
assess the validity of sources. Academic sources such as those found on
Google Scholar should be your primary source of arguments, ideas and
claims made in the course. While it may be appropriate to provide
anecdotal, non-academic, news, theories from outside the academy as data
points, all arguments must be situated in triangulated academic
research. By triangulation (you may see a ∆ on your assignments) this is
the idea that academic peer review provides a foundation for the
veracity of the claims being made. if you rely too heavily on one source
(i.e. that more than 3 footnotes in a row are from the same source ) you
may be veering towards summary or plagiarism of that source as it lacks
proper verification from other academics who agree with those
assessments . Moreover, most sources have implicit or explicit
frameworks, understandings, biases which you may not be able to assess
without triangulation. While there is no explicit number of sources
required on assignments, you will be unable to achieve full marks if you
do not have academic arguments with academic sources. This is a standard
expectation of all assignments in this class.

## Discussion Guidelines^2^

In our structured and unstructured discussions and dialogues, we also
will have many opportunities to explore some challenging, high-stakes
issues and increase our understandings of different perspectives. Our
conversations may not always be easy; we sometimes will make mistakes in
our speaking and our listening; sometimes we will need patience or
courage or imagination or any number of qualities in combination to
engage our texts, our classmates, and our own ideas and experiences.
Always we will need respect for others. Thus, an important secondary aim
of our course necessarily will be for us to increase our facility with
the sometimes-difficult conversations that arise inside issues of social
inequality as we deepen our understandings of multiple perspectives --
whatever our backgrounds, experiences, or positions.

## Contingency plan for an in-person class pivoting to 100% online learning

In the event of a COVID-19 resurgence during the course that
necessitates the course delivery moving away from face-to-face
interaction, affected course content will be delivered entirely online,
either synchronously (i.e., at the times indicated in the timetable) or
asynchronously (e.g., posted on OWL for students to view at their
convenience). The grading scheme will not change. Any remaining
assessments will also be conducted online as determined by the course
instructor.

## Late Assignments - Formal Guidelines

Late papers will be accepted, but will be subject to a late penalty of
10 per cent per day to a maximum of 5 days, after which they will not be
accepted and a mark of 0 will be recorded. In the interest of fairness
to all students, there will be no exceptions to this unless you have
arranged in advance for an extension. All extensions must be arranged in
advance of the day on which a paper is due**. Papers submitted after
deadlines (including excused late papers) will be marked, but comments
may not be** **provided.**

## Policy on the use of LLMs (AI, ChatGPT, Bard, etc) in the classroom **^3^**

Unless otherwise noted during class activities, you may only use ChatGPT
or any other Generative technology to *aid* or *nuance* your thinking,
communication, and learning; but not to *replace* or *subvert* it. See
the table below for some examples of allowable and non-allowable uses of
Generative technology in this class (NOTE: This is not an exhaustive
list of examples). Generative technology may be used to assist in
assessment throughout the course, if you wish to opt out of the use of
generative technology, please let me know.

How generative technology may be used in assessment:

1\. Pre-assessment - to provide structural or overall feedback before I
begin any grading.

2\. Applying rubric - using the rubric from the course outline to apply
to submitted assignments to assess the degree of compliance before or
during I complete any grading.

3\. During assessment - to double-check the veracity of claims being
made about your submission during my assessment of your material.

4\. Post assessment - to find additional examples or instances in your
submissions to assist in my feedback.

5\. Refining assessment - suggesting forms of constructive criticism,
actionable items, and overarching themes or issues to assist in your
assessment.

How generative technology will NOT be used in assessment:

No grades will be assigned solely with generative technology at any
point in this course. Assessment will always be done by the instructor
in accordance with the course outlines, because of the unpredictability
and unreliability of current generative technology.

No personal or individual identifiers will ever be included in the
assessment of material by any generative technology.
